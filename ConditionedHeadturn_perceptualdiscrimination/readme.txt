Stimuli here are placeholder examples of Hindi dental and retroflex unaspirated stops. They each contain only two distinct tokens and are not matched for intonation, among other things - they would not be used as-is in a real experiment. But this does make it easier for adult listeners who are unfamiliar with the sound contrast, running this protocol by themselves as practice, to accurately discriminate and better track when they make hits, misses, false alarms, and correct rejections, and what happens in each of these cases. If you find you cannot discriminate easily, feel free to swap the audio files in this example for any other audio files to use as an example, simply by changing the filenames referenced by the two audio tags.
